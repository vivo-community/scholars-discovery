  "overview": "Research areas focus on acquiring fundamental new knowledge of the avian immune system and applying this new knowledge toward the development  of new immuno-biotechnological tools.  Research projects include the study of the immune response in the chicken, especially the function of antigen presenting cells (such as the dendritic cells) in activating the humeral immune response and the development of chicken egg yolk antibodies, monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antibodies for diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. Dr. Berghman was the recipient of the 2016 Zoetis Fundamental Science Award.",
