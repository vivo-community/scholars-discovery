  "overview": "Dr. Vemulapalli's research is primarily focused on the development of recombinant vaccines against infectious diseases.  One of the targets of his vaccine research is  brucellosis, a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by certain members of the genus Brucella.  Brucellosis is a great concern to public health in developing countries due to widespread prevalence of Brucella infections in livestock.  In the US, reservoirs of Brucella infections in wildlife, such as bison, elk, and feral swine, continue to pose a threat to livestock industries and human health.  The currently available brucellosis veterinary vaccines are neither efficacious in wild animals nor safe for human use.  Dr. Vemulapalli has developed novel recombinant vaccine strains that showed dramatically enhanced vaccine efficacy against brucellosis in murine models.  Testing these vaccines in domestic and wild animals is a goal of his research program.  Research projects in his laboratory are aimed at 1) understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of Brucella species, 2) developing attenuated Brucella strains as vectors to deliver protective proteins of other pathogens and tumors, 3) developing recombinant subunit vaccines to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and 4) development of molecular diagnostics assays for infectious disease investigations.",
